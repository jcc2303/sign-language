     * transmission of serialized data ("artifacts") that represent the
     * model's topology and weights onto or via a specific medium, such as
     * file downloads, local storage, IndexedDB in the web browser and HTTP
     * requests to a server. TensorFlow.js provides `IOHandler`
     * implementations for a number of frequently used saving mediums, such as
     * `tf.io.browserDownloads` and `tf.io.browserLocalStorage`. See `tf.io`
     * for more details.
     *
     * This method also allows you to refer to certain types of `IOHandler`s
     * as URL-like string shortcuts, such as 'localstorage://' and
     * 'indexeddb://'.
     *
     * Example 1: Save `model`'s topology and weights to browser [local
     * storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage);
     * then load it back.
     *
     * ```js
     * const model = tf.sequential(
     *     {layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [3]})]});
     * console.log('Prediction from original model:');
     * model.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
     *
     * const saveResults = await model.save('localstorage://my-model-1');
     *
     * const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('localstorage://my-model-1');
     * console.log('Prediction from loaded model:');
     * loadedModel.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
     * ```
     *
     * Example 2. Saving `model`'s topology and weights to browser
     * [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API);
     * then load it back.

/**
 * A model is a data structure that consists of `Layers` and defines inputs
 * and outputs.
 *
 * The key difference between `tf.model` and `tf.sequential` is that
 * `tf.model` is more generic, supporting an arbitrary graph (without
 * cycles) of layers. `tf.sequential` is less generic and supports only a linear
 * stack of layers.
 *
 * When creating a `tf.LayersModel`, specify its input(s) and output(s). Layers
 * are used to wire input(s) to output(s).
 *
 * For example, the following code snippet defines a model consisting of
 * two `dense` layers, with 10 and 4 units, respectively.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Define input, which has a size of 5 (not including batch dimension).
 * const input = tf.input({shape: [5]});
 *
 * // First dense layer uses relu activation.
 * const denseLayer1 = tf.layers.dense({units: 10, activation: 'relu'});
 * // Second dense layer uses softmax activation.
 * const denseLayer2 = tf.layers.dense({units: 4, activation: 'softmax'});
 *
 * // Obtain the output symbolic tensor by applying the layers on the input.
 * const output = denseLayer2.apply(denseLayer1.apply(input));
 *
 * // Create the model based on the inputs.
 * const model = tf.model({inputs: input, outputs: output});
 *
 * // The model can be used for training, evaluation and prediction.
 * // For example, the following line runs prediction with the model on
 * // some fake data.
 * model.predict(tf.ones([2, 5])).print();
 * ```
 * See also:
 *   `tf.sequential`, `tf.loadLayersModel`.

/**
 * Creates a `tf.Sequential` model.  A sequential model is any model where the
 * outputs of one layer are the inputs to the next layer, i.e. the model
 * topology is a simple 'stack' of layers, with no branching or skipping.
 *
 * This means that the first layer passed to a `tf.Sequential` model should have
 * a defined input shape. What that means is that it should have received an
 * `inputShape` or `batchInputShape` argument, or for some type of layers
 * (recurrent, Dense...) an `inputDim` argument.
 *
 * The key difference between `tf.model` and `tf.sequential` is that
 * `tf.sequential` is less generic, supporting only a linear stack of layers.
 * `tf.model` is more generic and supports an arbitrary graph (without
 * cycles) of layers.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential();
 *
 * // First layer must have an input shape defined.
 * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}));
 * // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.
 * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));
 *
 * // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output, which equals
 * // `[null, 4]`. The 1st dimension is the undetermined batch dimension; the
 * // 2nd is the output size of the model's last layer.
 * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
 * ```
 *
 * It is also possible to specify a batch size (with potentially undetermined
 * batch dimension, denoted by "null") for the first layer using the
 * `batchInputShape` key. The following example is equivalent to the above:
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential();
 *
 * // First layer must have a defined input shape
 * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 32, batchInputShape: [null, 50]}));
 * // Afterwards, TF.js does automatic shape inference.
 * model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 4}));
 *
 * // Inspect the inferred shape of the model's output.
 * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use an `Array` of already-constructed `Layer`s to create
 * a `tf.Sequential` model:
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential({
 *   layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 32, inputShape: [50]}),
 *            tf.layers.dense({units: 4})]
 * });
 * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
 * ```

/**
 * Load a model composed of Layer objects, including its topology and optionally
 * weights. See the Tutorial named "How to import a Keras Model" for usage
 * examples.
 *
 * This method is applicable to:
 *
 * 1. Models created with the `tf.layers.*`, `tf.sequential`, and
 * `tf.model` APIs of TensorFlow.js and later saved with the
 * `tf.LayersModel.save` method.
 * 2. Models converted from Keras or TensorFlow tf.keras using the
 * [tensorflowjs_converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter).
 *
 * This mode is *not* applicable to TensorFlow `SavedModel`s or their converted
 * forms. For those models, use `tf.loadGraphModel`.
 *
 * Example 1. Load a model from an HTTP server.
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = await tf.loadLayersModel(
 *     'https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/tfjs/iris_v1/model.json');
 * model.summary();
 * ```
 *
 * Example 2: Save `model`'s topology and weights to browser [local
 * storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage);
 * then load it back.
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential(
 *     {layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [3]})]});
 * console.log('Prediction from original model:');
 * model.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
 *
 * const saveResults = await model.save('localstorage://my-model-1');
 *
 * const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('localstorage://my-model-1');
 * console.log('Prediction from loaded model:');
 * loadedModel.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
 * ```
 *
 * Example 3. Saving `model`'s topology and weights to browser
 * [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API);
 * then load it back.
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential(
 *     {layers: [tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [3]})]});
 * console.log('Prediction from original model:');
 * model.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
 *
 * const saveResults = await model.save('indexeddb://my-model-1');
 *
 * const loadedModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('indexeddb://my-model-1');
 * console.log('Prediction from loaded model:');
 * loadedModel.predict(tf.ones([1, 3])).print();
 * ```
 *
 * Example 4. Load a model from user-selected files from HTML
 * [file input
 * elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file).
 *
 * ```js
 * // Note: this code snippet will not work without the HTML elements in the
 * //   page
 * const jsonUpload = document.getElementById('json-upload');
 * const weightsUpload = document.getElementById('weights-upload');
 *
 * const model = await tf.loadLayersModel(
 *     tf.io.browserFiles([jsonUpload.files[0], weightsUpload.files[0]]));
 * ```
 *
 * @param pathOrIOHandler Can be either of the two formats
 *   1. A string path to the `ModelAndWeightsConfig` JSON describing
 *      the model in the canonical TensorFlow.js format. For file://
 *      (tfjs-node-only), http:// and https:// schemas, the path can be
 *      either absolute or relative.
 *   2. An `tf.io.IOHandler` object that loads model artifacts with its `load`
 *      method.
 * @param options Optional configuration arguments for the model loading,
 *   including:
 *   - `strict`: Require that the provided weights exactly match those required
 *     by the layers.  Default true.  Passing false means that both extra
 *     weights and missing weights will be silently ignored.
 *   - `onProgress`: A function of the signature `(fraction: number) => void',
 *     that can be used as the progress callback for the model loading.
 * @returns A `Promise` of `tf.LayersModel`, with the topology and weights
 *     loaded.

 * Alpha Dropout is a `Dropout` that keeps mean and variance of inputs

 * Alpha Dropout fits well to Scaled Exponential Linear Units
 * by randomly setting activations to the negative saturation value.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   - `rate`: float, drop probability (as with `Dropout`).
 *     The multiplicative noise will have
 *     standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.
 *   - `noise_shape`: A 1-D `Tensor` of type `int32`, representing the
 *     shape for randomly generated keep/drop flags.
 *
 * Input shape:
 *   Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `inputShape`
 *   (tuple of integers, does not include the samples axis)
 *   when using this layer as the first layer in a model.
 *
 * Output shape:

/**
 * An input layer is an entry point into a `tf.LayersModel`.
 *
 * `InputLayer` is generated automatically for `tf.Sequential`` models by
 * specifying the `inputshape` or `batchInputShape` for the first layer.  It
 * should not be specified explicitly. However, it can be useful sometimes,
 * e.g., when constructing a sequential model from a subset of another
 * sequential model's layers. Like the code snippet below shows.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Define a model which simply adds two inputs.
 * const model1 = tf.sequential();
 * model1.add(tf.layers.dense({inputShape: [4], units: 3, activation: 'relu'}));
 * model1.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid'}));
 * model1.summary();
 * model1.predict(tf.zeros([1, 4])).print();
 *
 * // Construct another model, reusing the second layer of `model1` while
 * // not using the first layer of `model1`. Note that you cannot add the second
 * // layer of `model` directly as the first layer of the new sequential model,
 * // because doing so will lead to an error related to the fact that the layer
 * // is not an input layer. Instead, you need to create an `inputLayer` and add
 * // it to the new sequential model before adding the reused layer.
 * const model2 = tf.sequential();
 * // Use an inputShape that matches the input shape of `model1`'s second
 * // layer.
 * model2.add(tf.layers.inputLayer({inputShape: [3]}));
 * model2.add(model1.layers[1]);
 * model2.summary();
 * model2.predict(tf.zeros([1, 3])).print();

 * Masking:
 *   This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number

 *   set to `True`.
 *
 * Notes on using statefulness in RNNs:
 *   You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful', which means that the states
 *   computed for the samples in one batch will be reused as initial states
 *   for the samples in the next batch. This assumes a one-to-one mapping
 *   between samples in different successive batches.
 *
 *   To enable statefulness:
 *     - specify `stateful: true` in the layer constructor.
 *     - specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing
 *       if sequential model:
 *         `batchInputShape=[...]` to the first layer in your model.
 *       else for functional model with 1 or more Input layers:
 *         `batchShape=[...]` to all the first layers in your model.
 *       This is the expected shape of your inputs *including the batch size*.
 *       It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100)`.
 *     - specify `shuffle=False` when calling fit().
 *
 *   To reset the states of your model, call `.resetStates()` on either
 *   a specific layer, or on your entire model.
 *
 * Note on specifying the initial state of RNNs
 *   You can specify the initial state of RNN layers symbolically by
 *   calling them with the option `initialState`. The value of
 *   `initialState` should be a tensor or list of tensors representing
 *   the initial state of the RNN layer.
 *

 *
 * Consider a batch of 32 samples, where each sample is a sequence of 10 vectors

 * timesteps, independently:
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential();
 * model.add(tf.layers.timeDistributed({
 *   layer: tf.layers.dense({units: 8}),
 *   inputShape: [10, 16],
 * }));

 * // The output will then have shape `[32, 10, 8]`.
 *
 * // In subsequent layers, there is no need for `inputShape`:
 * model.add(tf.layers.timeDistributed({layer: tf.layers.dense({units: 32})}));
 * console.log(JSON.stringify(model.outputs[0].shape));
 * // Now model.outputShape = [null, 10, 32].
 * ```
 *
 * The output will then have shape `[32, 10, 32]`.
 *
 * `TimeDistributed` can be used with arbitrary layers, not just `Dense`, for
 * instance a `Conv2D` layer.
 *
 * ```js
 * const model = tf.sequential();
 * model.add(tf.layers.timeDistributed({
